What is this?

This is a set of instructions for how to treat people when it comes to their gender preferences. It describes the genders that are available, their pronouns, the rules around changing gender, and the way to ask questions in a polite way.

Why have you made this?

For the majority of of my life, the rules on gender appeared to be stable and unchanging. However, after interacting with non-binary people and trans people, it became clear that the rules I'd learned weren't sufficient to cover those situations. It was also clear that the regime that managed those rules wasn't sufficient either. The rules on gender were updated as social conventions, rather than written down anywhere, and it was confusing which rules applied in which situation. This protocol is intended to serve as a source of truth for the rules.

How is this intended to be used?

If you read this protocol and think the instructions make sense, follow them. If you want, put "I follow the IGP" in your bio with a link to this repo.

Who decides what goes into the IGP?

Currently, I do. I'm hoping to have a governing body in future that decides on future changes.

Can I change the IGP?

You can definitely suggest changes, and if the IGP governing body (currently just me) thinks they're an improvement, the change will go into the next build. The IGP is designed to change gradually, so while the build schedule will be quite rapid intially, over time it should slow down to having scheduled release once every 6 months or something like that. 

If my changes don't make it into the IGP, can I make my own protocol?

Absolutely! I don't see the IGP as the final say on gender protocols. Feel free to fork it and create your own set of instructions that suit you. What I'd love to see is an ecosystem of rulesets, where different needs can be catered for.

What needs does the IGP cater for?

The IGP is designed for mainstream adoption, so clarity, ease of use and pragmatism are what it aims to acheive. If a person is following the IGP, they should feel fine knowing they're getting the rules right.

How can I thank you for your important work?

The satisfaction of improving the world is more than enough for me. But if you must display your gratitude, please donate to charity on my behalf.
