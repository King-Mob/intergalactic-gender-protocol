A gender is defined as a range on the gender spectrum, ranging from 100% masculine to 100% feminine.

In the Intergalatic Gender Protocol there are 3 genders, men, women and non-binaries.

| Gender      | Pronoun     | Position on gender spectrum |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Women      | she/her       | Most feminine              |
| Non-binaries   | they/them      | In between feminine and masculine |
| Men      | he/him      | Most masculine              |

Gender can be presented in many ways, including but not limited to:
* choice of name
* listing pronouns in bio
* choice of attire and aesthetic

When in doubt, ask.
